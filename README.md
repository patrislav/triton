# Triton

An experimental ternary stack-based CPU architecture. This crate includes the VM able to decode and run Triton programs. This is *not* a full emulator, but it's intended to be used as a library for other applications to use.

## Status

The architecture is not yet finalized, the instruction set not fully designed and there are no tests.
